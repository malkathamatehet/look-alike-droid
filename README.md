# Look Alike Droid (LAD) Source Code

This repo houses the script that runs the LAD, aka the "lad brain".

### How to use our code

1. lad_brain is intended to be run on a raspberry pi with the PiCamera module. Set up a Raspberry Pi and copy the code onto it.
2. Refer to the requirements.txt file for necessary libraries to install. Picamera should already be installed on more recent versions of the Raspberry Pi.
